This example demonstrates a common misconception in F# concerning mutable variables and function parameters.  When passing mutable variables to a function, a copy of the value is passed, not the reference. Thus, modifying the variable within the function doesn't affect the original variable outside the function's scope. This leads to incorrect results when trying to implement operations that require in-place modifications, such as swapping variables.
